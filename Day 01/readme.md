# 1. Web Dev
>with MERN Stack

If I have to start my coding journey now from the beginning so, I'll start by learning web development.

## Why web development?
1. Because I can! ðŸ˜‚
2. Easy to learn.
3. Fastest way to become job ready.

## HTML - Step 1 in web development
I'll not be worring about what is MERN Stack or anything else, like I said, focus one thing at a time.  

I'll first try to learn HTML, the syllabus of HTML in itself is big if we go deeper but I'll stick to the basic and learn what is actually needed, it will take hardly 1 day to complete HTML. 

>Trust me we don't need to know everything.

I have explored many youtube channels but I like **Kevin Powell's** youtube channel the most so I'll do this first. Here's the link: [HTML Playlist by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT-)

I'll just watch from 1st video upto 8th video which is, **"HTML & CSS for Beginners Part 8: Introduction to CSS"**
