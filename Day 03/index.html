                    <p>
                        Back in 2020, when a harmful virus put the world on pause, I found myself entering college under
                        unique circumstances. Everything was online, which gave me plenty of time to hone my skills. My
                        love for sketching and fascination with computers led me to pursue a degree in <span
                            class="h-primary">Computer Science
                            & Engineering</span>.<br><br>
                        During my college years, I was selected as a Graphic Design Executive at the <span
                            class="h-primary">MU-ACM</span> technical
                        club. This role allowed me to polish my design skills and deepen my interest in the field. I
                        also had the chance to connect with seniors and working professionals, building valuable
                        relationships with my college faculty, who were incredibly supportive.<br><br>
                        Leading volunteers as part of my role at MU-ACM enhanced my leadership and communication skills.
                        My proficiency in design earned me positions in other clubs like MIIC and NSS. During this
                        period, I developed a passion for 3D design and started learning Blender, an open-source
                        software. My skills in Blender flourished, and I created numerous artworks.<br><br>
                        In 2023, when college resumed in person, I had already established a strong reputation with the
                        faculty. In my third year, I <span class="h-primary">co-founded MUIEEE</span> and served as its
                        vice-president. Organizing
                        orientations, events, and workshops, as well as conducting interviews, was an exhilarating
                        experience. I was also part of the team that organized Convocation '22 and the Alumni Meet,
                        which were filled with fun moments.<br><br>
                        <div class="show-more">
                            At MUIEEE, we successfully hosted our university's <span class="h-primary">first E-Sports
                                event</span>, CampusKombat, during our
                            annual fest, Moonstone. Meanwhile, my coding journey continued as I delved into subjects like
                            Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization and Architecture, Database Management
                            Systems, Compiler Design, C++, Core Java, Cloud Computing, and Cyber Security.<br><br>
                            Reflecting on my high school days, I remember computer classes where we would enter the lab
                            barefoot, learn basic HTML, and I would experiment by editing HTML files in MS Word to create
                            visually appealing web pages. This early experience sparked my interest in web
                            development.<br><br>
                            During the lockdown, I revisited my web development skills, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            I built the frontend of a blogging website for a friend on Blogger.com and even created a
                            website for one of my faculty's companies. In college, I contributed to the development of
                            various websites, including website for our college.<br><br>
                            In my final year, I was offered an internship by my university, a proud moment as it was the
                            first time they extended such an offer. However, I declined and instead pursued a research
                            internship where I discovered web development libraries and frameworks. This new knowledge
                            fueled my interest, leading me to build projects and gain confidence.<br><br>
                            Eventually, I landed a job at <span class="h-primary">eHawkers</span>, where I quickly became
                            the design lead for an e-commerce
                            project. Then, I received an offer for a government internship from the <span
                                class="h-primary">District eGovernance
                                Society</span>. Leading a team, I developed a mobile application and admin panel for the Lok
                            Sabha
                            election 2024.<br><br>
                            Looking back, this journey has been a blend of creativity, leadership, and continuous learning,
                            shaping me into the professional I am today.
